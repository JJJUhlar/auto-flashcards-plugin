# Auto Flashcards
Autoflashcards is a plugin for chrome that helps you remember anything. To use auto flashcards you will need to setup a server from **https://github.com/JJJUhlar/flashcards-server**

## Main features:
- Highlight any text you want to remember in Chrome and right click **"make flashcards"**
- A set of flashcards sumarising the highlighted text will be automatically generated by an AI, which you can view by clicking on the extension icon and the 'create panel'.
- Use the 'review' panel to practice your flashcards. Auto Flashcards uses a spaced repetition system to optimise your recollection. If you forget the answer to a flashcard, autoflashcard will open it's source material in a new tab, for you to review.

## Setup
1. Fork / Clone repo locally
2. Open Chrome
3. Click 'extensions' button in the top right corner (looks like a jigsaw piece) and go to 'Manage Extensions' page
